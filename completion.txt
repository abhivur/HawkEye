What we roughly have so far:

Have Video 

->

Have frame splititng with OpenCV 

-> 

Have YOLO object detection

->

Have Pass text from YOLO to embedding generator

-> 

Have embeddings produce vector

-> 

MISSING SIMILARITY SEARCH

-> 

MISSING MATCHING AND DECISION (next frame or finish)

->

MISSING SYSTEM OUTPUT (ex: "red ball found found at 1:34")
